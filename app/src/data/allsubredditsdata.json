Of course I am speaking of popular and trustworthy exchanges. Leaving your crypto on an exchange nobody has ever heard of is of course a dumb idea.\n\nBut do you want to tell me that your crypto is not safe on Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com or Voyager? It is 2021 and not 2014 and these exchanges can not be compared to Mt Gox.\n\nAlso sometimes people get the whole \"not your keys, not your crypto\" thing too seriously. I have seen people here complainig that they lost a big amount of their ETH to move it to a cold wallet. Well, high gas fees are another topic but you definitely shouldn't move your crypto to a wallet if you have to lose like 1\/4 of it to do that. If you just have 0.05 ETH or similar then just leave it on the exchange. Nothing will happen to it.\n\nNot to mention that if you are new in crypto then it is more likely for you to lose your piece of paper with your seed phrase than an exchange like Kraken or Coinbase to get hacked. If you ever accumulate a bigger amount of crypto then you could think about buying a cold wallet!\n\nPS I originally [posted this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/phepj2\/no_leaving_your_crypto_on_an_exchange_is_not_the\/) on friday but it got deleted for mentioning ETH in the title because there were already many posts about ETH.

In short: their inadvertent holding made them exceedingly wealthy. \n\nThe fact is that \u201chodl\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cnever sell\u201d it just means \u201ctry not to sell before you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d There\u2019s nothing noble about \u201cnever selling\u201d your coins\u2014you tell yourself you\u2019ll hodl through thick and thin\u2014watch the comments like \u201cI\u2019m in cold storage and just grabbing the popcorn\u201d while the market is in free fall.\u2014but that means you have no idea just how cold crypto winter can get.\n\nYour \u201cloyalty\u201d will mean jack-all when your portfolio has gone from $300k to $3k. \n\n\t2. Take the Money and Run:\n\nSet a goal and STICK TO IT. If you\u2019ve made life changing money, or just enough for that goal: a new car, a new computer, college loans, etc.\u2014don\u2019t roll the profits over into the next coin poised to explode \u2014  just take the money and run. Do what you planned to with it, celebrate, and enjoy your success (no matter what that success looks like). The bear will come and you can buy back in.\n\nGreed is a bottomless pit and always chasing \u201ca little bit more\u201d will never make you happy. Remember that meme of the dude at the party standing in the corner while everyone else is having fun: \u201cThey dont know i have ETH.\u201d \n\nNews flash: yes they do. But even so, living is way more important than hodling\u2014and the people dancing, having a genuinely good time living life, are in a way better position than the guy in the corner with his ETH.\n\n\t3. You don\u2019t start spending the money until you\u2019ve lost the money.\n\nI remember the first time I experienced my portfolio climbing $5k\/$10k per day. It was insanity. All of a sudden money became cheap. Easy to throw away, easy to take for granted. Amounts of money that I had never dreamed could have become accessible to me had suddenly become nothing more than crumbs. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the proceeding bear market\u2014when it had \u2018dip\u2019-by-\u2018dip\u2019 fizzled to almost nothing did I start to think about what I could have spent all that cash on. I had tried so hard to maximize my gains that I was afraid to sell anything\u2014lest my portfolio grow less exponentially than it otherwise would have. \n\nSo many moments in the proceeding bear market where I tormented myself with questions: \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I at least buy a nice car?\u201d Or \u201cI could have sold enough for a house and still have more in my portfolio than I currently have\u201d, or \u201cMan I could have bought so much ETH now if I had sold back then.\u201d \n\nA lot of regret made me fall out of love with \u201chodl\u201d.\n\n    4.  The bull market does come to an end.\n\nYes yes\u2014institutions, mainstream, celebrities, El Salvador, PayPal, etc. Blah blah blah.\n\nRemember: the \u201cinstitutions\u201d make money when the market goes up and they make more money when the market goes down. Governments are corrupt and will pass and nullify laws for their benefit. \n\nThe bull run will absolutely come to an an end\u2014and while no one knows when \u201cTHE\u201d bull ends, you can very much know when YOUR bull ends: when you\u2019ve hit your goal.\n\nBrace yourselves, and God Speed.","2":"This is huge. Ethereum just closed the day burning more Ethereum than mined.

After re-analyzing I can confirm it is still on track and should roughly complete in the 3rd week. This is when the 50 day moving average (DMA) will cross above the 200 DMA. The last time this happened was in May 2020 which led to a BTC rallying from $8,000 to $64,800 (+700%). Don't expect a 700% gain again but I can foresee this golden crossover pushing BTC to $80K and perhaps finally to the famous $100K mark everyone has been waiting on for awhile now. I still think we're on track to see $100K BTC in late January to early March 2022 if the golden cross completes in September. \n      \nIn my previous post (20 days ago) I said if you're feeling bullish on this current rally you should not wait to buy BTC, since then the price has already risen 9% (from $45K to $49K). If the golden cross pans out there is still plenty of time to buy now. However, the longer you wait the more you'll pay so again, if you're bullish, pick up some BTC now and enjoy the ride to $100K!","5":"But $100 each week might. I did a poll here about a week ago asking what everyone's portfolio values were. The majority of people (12% of those polled) were in the $1000-$5000 range. For many, this is a huge sum of money. Depending on where you live or your living conditions this could range from a month's pay to a year's, and if you have your entire year's salary invested that's awesome! That being said, unless I miss my guess the majority of the members of this subreddit are from the US, Canada, and UK. \n\nHere's the thing: if you want life changing wealth, whatever that means to you, you need to invest a decent chunk of change. If you threw $100 into the market just to \"see what happens\" it's not going to do much unless you're making some extremely risky plays which may as well be scratch off lottery tickets.\n\nIf you want to build wealth it will take time and money, and a lot of both. Get into the habit of putting a percentage of your paycheck directly into your investments. Crypto, stocks, precious metals, NFTs, whatever, just always be buying, especially when you're starting out. \n\nDCA every day, this is the Gwei.","6":"","7":"Where are we in the current bull market? Not even close to the Peak. 200-300k btc and 20k ETH coming, so hang onto your hats.\n\nThere\u2019s a super interesting and useful article that was posted yesterday. I\u2019ve been here about 7 years now, definitely haven\u2019t made any real gains during that time, but just bided my time and paid attention to long term patterns. I got scammed and lost 20k back in 2015. Basically my entire life savings. Had to start over and dig out of a massive hole. I didn\u2019t give up. I persisted and came back from my lowest point ever in life. Now I\u2019m here and 2021 is the time to get rich! For all of us, friends.\n\nI especially pay attention to Charlie Lee, who sold all his Litecoin at $350. He basically called the last market top to a T. He says we have a LONG way to go in this current bull run. \n\nUsually, we see 15x-16x gains from peak to market peak. We\u2019ve only hit 3x so far in this market cycle. That means we could be looking at 300k Bitcoin in the not too distant future. And 21k ETH.\n\nIf we all follow this, we are going to make some serious coin. No matter when you bought, no matter how much or how little you have, if you wait and sell during the euphoria (blow off top) when there\u2019s a 2x price increase in a 24 hour span, you are destined for massive gains. Then, buy back in a few months later when the market is crashing 80% all the way back to 2T (current levels).\n\nThe article is on cointelegraph and it\u2019s called \u201cHow to prepare for the end of the bull run, Part 1: Timing\u201d I\u2019m posting the actual link in the comments below so it doesn\u2019t get deleted. \n\nCurious to hear your thoughts, and this article has me feeling so damn bullish.

This job is extremely rewarding, but almost equally as frustrating, especially when it comes to budgeting for our students\u2019 education. This hits my classes particularly hard, being that they are technology-focused and require hardware and software that eats away at the school\u2019s budget. When I ask for something as simple as new mice for the computers, it\u2019s often met with a sigh of exasperation from the administration.\n\nNo teacher wants their students to be at a disadvantage just because their classroom doesn\u2019t include the latest gadgets and technology.

He looks down and to his surprise, its a metal back up for a seed phrase that Satoshi placed in the tree. So he asked himself, exchange or hardware wallet? Instead of answering this crucial question, he went onto do useless stuff like studying gravity. The question has been left, until today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Intro\n\nHello crypto lovers!\n\nRecently I have seen numerous posts from both CHADS and BRADS regarding where the best place is to store your crypto - many just masquerading good points but are actually shit posts. I decided to take it a step further by masquerading as a shit post but actually doing some research. Below I will discuss both hardware wallets and exchanges. \n\nFor exchanges, I will answer 3 basic questions, these questions will cover, how was security in the past, how is present security, what happens something goes wrong? Here are are the 3 questions:\n\n* Have they been hacked in the past? By hacking, I do not mean individual account getting hacked (due to practices of the individual), but the exchange getting hacked. \n* What do they do to secure your crypto\/account?\n* Do they have insurance? \n\nFor hardware wallets, I will answer 2 basic questions:\n\n* Have they been hacked in the past?\n* How secure are they? (Security features)\n\n***NOTE: This post is for educational purposes, it does not advocate for anything method specifically and if you read till the end you will see why.*** *But 2 points must be stated:*\n\n1. *I have a bias towards hardware wallets (if you read the seed phrase part, you will see why) but I am attempting to speak impartially.*\n2. *If I have made a mistake, please tell me an I will fix it.*\n\nLet's get into it! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Analysis of Popular Exchanges\/Brokers\n\n# Coinbase\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* Coinbase has actually never been hacked in the past! This is great news considering that they have been around since 2012 and is how a public listed company. \n\n***What do they do to secure your crypto\/account?***\n\n* Coinbase states that 98% of the customers funds are stores in offline storages and sensitive data is disconnected entirely from the internet. Data is AES-256 encrypted (unbreakable by brute force by current computing power), then copied to FIPS-140 USB drives and paper backups. These drives and paper backups are then distributed to geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world.\n* Internal practices - Each employee undergoes a criminal background check, they are required to encrypt their hard drives, utilise strong passwords, and enable screen locking.\n* SQL injection filters are used to prevent CSRF attacks (attacks that force a user to execute unwanted actions on web applications in which they are logged into eg: tricking you into transferring your funds).\n* Encourage use of strong password and 2FA - they allow 2FA through authenticator apps (eg: Google authenticator). Great way to avoid SIM swaps. \n* Whitelisting - This allows the user to designate addresses to an address book. This means that Coinbase can only withdraw funds to designated address books making it difficult for hackers to take funds out in case they get access to your account. Removing addresses or adding addresses requires 2FA. \n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* Coinbase has insurance that protects a *portion of digital assets* held across storage systems in case of theft, especially cyber security breaches. If breaches exceed insurance, total recovery may not be possible.\n* Coinbase has insurance for US customers on fiat - up to $250,000 USD. \n* Insurance policy *does not cover losses resulting from unauthorised access to personal Coinbase account* due to a breach of loss of credentials.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Binance.US\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* In 2019, hackers stole 7000 bitcoin from Binance. The funds represented a small fraction of Binance funds and came out of their hot wallets. Hackers also managed to get user information including 2FA codes. Binance covered incident in full.

I did some major digging and for every other exchange they tell you exactly what their security measures are. I am not alone, here is a post on August 30th 2021 by [Time.com](https:\/\/Time.com) stating the same thing, scroll down to part about security: [https:\/\/time.com\/nextadvisor\/investing\/cryptocurrency\/binance-us-review\/](https:\/\/time.com\/nextadvisor\/investing\/cryptocurrency\/binance-us-review\/)\n* I would urge them to be transparent. \n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* Again, information was incredibly difficult to find from a primary source.\n* [Yahoo.com](https:\/\/Yahoo.com) has stated that their USD deposits are insured according to a blog post published by Binance but this has been taken removed since. Here is a link to the Yahoo post: [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/binance-u-adds-fdic-insurance-180831092.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/binance-u-adds-fdic-insurance-180831092.html)\n* Again, I urge transparency. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Kraken\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* Kraken has never been hacked since its launch in 2013 and from multiple sources is considered one of the most secure cryptocurrency exchanges!\n\n***What do they do to secure your crypto\/account?***\n\n* Hired a global team of top security professionals that has experience in building security programs for the world's top brands.\n* 95% of deposits are kept in offline, air-gapped geographically distributed cold storage.\n* They keep FULL reserves so that withdrawals are immediate.\n* Their servers are in secure cages under 24\/7 surveillance by armed guards and video monitors. Physical access and code deployment are strictly controlled. Nothing leaves without intensive review.\n* Sensitive account info is encrypted at both the system and data level.\n* They conduct tests on their own servers by an expert team and has offered the bug bounty program to the community to find broader security issues. \n* 2FA\n* doesn't allow phone\/SMS recover - rules out SIM swaps.\n* Interesting note: Kraken as developed \"Kraken Security Labs\" to test third-party services and products as well as theirs in an effort to help identify and publicise issues before they are exploited. \n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* Kraken states that cryptocurrency exchanges do not quality for deposit insurance because they are not classified as \"saving institutions\". \n* Kraken actually encourages the use of hardware wallets and states that Kraken should not be treated as a wallet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gemini\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* Nope! Great job!\n\n***What do they do to secure your crypto\/account?***\n\n* Majority of customer's crypto is held offline in an air-gapped cold storage system. Only a small amount is on the online hot wallet. Note: air-gapped basically means not connected to the internet.\n* Use of HSM (hardware security module) that has achieved a FIPS 14-2 level 3 or higher. You can see what that means here: [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FIPS\\_140-2#Level\\_3](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/FIPS_140-2#Level_3)\n* Private keys are generated on the HSMs and stores and managed there for their lifetime.\n* HSMs are geographically distributed and stores in monitored, access-controlled facilities. \n* Use of multisig - eliminates single points of failure and improves resilience against loss or compromised of individual keys.\n* HSMs require coordinated actions of multiple employees to operate.\n* 2FA.\n* VERY INTERESTING: Gemini support the use of hardware security keys via WebAuthn, you can use your USB security keys (ie your hardware wallet) as a two-factor authentication method to signing into your Gemini account. From my research this doesn't mean you have to give them your seed phrase but rather you can use the physical aspect of a hardware wallet (ie holding down the screen or button) as a method of 2FA.\n* Whitelisting of approved addresses.\n* For their cold storage, multiple signatories are required to transfer cryptocurrency out of cold storage system. \n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* Hot wallet insurance.\n* Cold wallet insurance - $200 million coverage, company states that this is the most out of any cryptocurrency exchange in the world. My research hasn't proven otherwise.\n* Option to buy additional insurance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Crypto.com\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* Could not find evidence of hacking, great job!\n\n***What do they do to secure your account\/crypto?***\n\n* Ongoing training of staff for security and privacy awareness.\n* All transactions are monitored for compliance and a dedicated team is in charge of this process.\n* An impressive 100% of cryptocurrencies are held in offline cold storage.\n* Use of HSM.\n* Use of multisig.\n* Strict controls of access rights to funds in cold and hot wallets - making it difficult for a single actor to withdraw funds.\n* Multi-factor authentication for accounts.\n* Hackers One bounty program to find exploits and bugs.\n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* $30 million USD in cold storage insurance against physical damage or destruction, and third party theft.\n* US residents USD balances in exchange are covered up to $250,000 per FDIC insurance - fiat also cannot be claimed by creditors. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Robinhood\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* Have had hacks in the past but not crypto specific, so I will omit it. \n\n***What do they do to secure your crypto\/account?***\n\n* States that majority of coins are held in cold storage, some held on hot wallets to support day-to-day operations.\n* Strict operational security when managing cryptocurrencies - eg: coin transfers require authorisation of a select group of people. The people who make up this group are rotated for added security. \n* Security team at Robinhood routinely reviews code and infrastructure of their crypto.\n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* Crime insurance that protects a portion of digital assets held against losses from theft and cybersecurity breaches. These do not cover individual user's negligence (similar to Coinbase).\n* US residents USD balances are covered up to $250,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Analysis of Popular Exchanges\/Brokers - AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND SPECIFIC\n\n# Swyftx \n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* Nope!\n\n***What do they do to secure your crypto\/account?***\n\n* Says they supply a \"robust security framework\" - quite general IMO.\n* Runs 24\/7 customer DD programs to secure identity.\n* Uses JWT tokens.\n* Session expiry - ie it'll log you out after a while.\n* 2FA.\n* Checks for breaches passwords on other websites.\n* Undergoing external penetration testing (testing strength of their security).\n* Implementing a least privilege security model (idea is that it's difficult for one person to withdraw company\/customer funds). \n* Integrated with Auth0 - specialises in cloud platform security to maintain the highest level of password and account safety. \n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* No information. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# CoinSpot\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* No evidence of hacking! Good job!\n\n***What do they do to secure your crypto\/account?***\n\n* ISO 27001 certificate - an external audit was undertaken basically checking ALL aspects of security on the exchange and they passed. Very impressive. \n* Vast majority (unspecified) of assets are in highly secure offline locations.\n* 2FA.\n* Session timeouts.\n* Withdrawal restrictions.\n* Hacker One bounty program. \n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* No information on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Independent Reserve\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* Nope! Great job!\n\n***What do they do to secure your crypto?***\n\n* Core servers are held in two tier 3 data centres - ensuring 0 data loss should one site have an outage. \n* Fully functional backup for data. \n* All customer data is signed and encrypted multiple times using geographically dispersed keys, spread across four data centres. \n* Vast majority of digital assets are held in cold storage. The cold storage is secured by multi-layer encryption and is stores in physical vaults in geographically diverse locations.\n* Accessing vaults has high physical security requiring biometric authentication of all persons. \n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* You can get insurance on their premium account service, this gives you the ability to insure from $20,000 AUD up to $5million AUD. But you must pay for the service (depending on amount you want to insure).\n* No evidence of insurance outside the premium plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Easy Crypto (not exchange, a broker\/retailer)\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* No, but they don't hold funds.\n\n***What do they do to secure your crypto?***\n\n* Has 2FA on the account.\n* No funds are held so understandable that not a huge amount of security in place.\n\n***Do they have insurance?***\n\n* Their trades are guaranteed. They state that there is NEVER a risk of losing funds while using their platform. From the time they receive customer payment, until order is delivered, Easy Crypto fully grantees the safety of funds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Analysis of Hardware Wallets\n\nFor hardware wallets, the focus is similar but the insurance question is removed as individuals can sort out their own insurance. I will focus on the 4 major hardware wallet providers - Ledger, Trezor, ColdCard, KeepKey. \n\n# Ledger\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* Security flaw discovered in 2018 which basically allowed resellers to update the devices with malicious code and then siphon the private key and drain user's crypto accounts. But this has been fixed. Read about it here:  [https:\/\/krebsonsecurity.com\/2018\/03\/15-year-old-finds-flaw-in-ledger-crypto-wallet\/](https:\/\/krebsonsecurity.com\/2018\/03\/15-year-old-finds-flaw-in-ledger-crypto-wallet\/)\n* In 2020, Ledger fell victim to a cyberattack are malicious software was installed on one of their servers. It became technically impossible to make an assessment of severity of the data breach.\n* The hack was mainly customer personal information from their e-commerce and marketing database.\n* Importantly: NO LEDGER DEVICE WAS HACKED DIRECTLY AS LEDGER DOES NOT HAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE, SO DON'T PANIC IF YOU HOLD A LEDGER DEVICE. But many customers received phishing emails and it is likely some fell victim to these and gave away their seed phrase and as a result got compromised. \n\n***How secure are they?***\n\n* Offline storage.\n* Ledger claims to have the only certified hardware wallet on the market. Ledger's wallets are certified for security by the ANSSI, the French cyber security agency.\n* Ledger wallets integrate a certified chip, designed to withstand sophisticated attacks. \n* Ledger wallets have their own custom OS (BOLOS) to protect against malicious attacks and isolate apps from each other.\n* Security seals on packages to avoid tampering.\n* Root of Trust - Every time a Ledger device performs a critical action at the firmware level (such as updating OS or installing or removing apps) an HSM will send a challenge to the device (a randomly generated number). This is a way of requesting the device to prove its genuineness - the device proves its genuineness by providing the correct signature for the challenge. If the device cannot provide genuineness, then the server blocks the device. You can read more abut it here: [https:\/\/www.ledger.com\/a-closer-look-into-ledger-security-the-root-of-trust](https:\/\/www.ledger.com\/a-closer-look-into-ledger-security-the-root-of-trust)\n* Physical confirmation before transfer of funds.\n* Passphrase security - this is a password added to your 24 word security phrase. This pass phrase protects your assets if your 24-word recover phrase is compromised, so this means that the attacker will need your seed phrase as well as your secret passphrase. \n* Ledger's seed phrase is compatible with BIP-39, so if Ledger ever ceases to exist, then your funds will not be lost.\n* Physical button.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Trezor\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* No confirmed hacks\n* Hacker claimed they have information on Trezor's customers but never confirmed and Trezor believes this to be a false claim.\n* Kraken claims that they used specialised hardware to hack into Trezor devices. The trick allowed an attacker to read critical wallet parameters, including the private key. You can read more about it here: [https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/trezor-wallets-can-be-hacked-kraken-reveals](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/trezor-wallets-can-be-hacked-kraken-reveals)\n* NOTE: on the above point, the attack requires the Trezor device and it must be opened and extremely specialised hardware to do this. Not sure if it has been \"patched\" but no reported cases of this happening.\n\n***How secure are they?***\n\n* Offline storage.\n* The Bip-39 Phrase is never remembered nor stored on the device.\n* Bootloader verifies the firmware signature - firmware runs only if correctly signed by SatoshiLabs. If signature is invalid, bootloader erases device memory. \n* All operations function only if private and public keys are allowed after user authentication via PIN.\n* Passphrase security - this is a password added to your 24 word security phrase. This pass phrase protects your assets if your 24-word recover phrase is compromised, so this means that the attacker will need your seed phrase as well as your secret passphrase. \n* Trezor hardware case is ultrasonically welded, making it difficult to be restored after breakage (ie 3rd party seller cannot tamper with it then sell it off)\n* PIN code protection against brute force - waiting time between attempts on pin code increases by power of two every single time a wrong PIN is entered. \n* Trezor is compatible with BIP-32, 39, and 44 wallets. So if Trezor shuts down, you can still access your funds. Also, all of Trezor's code is public meaning that developers can maintain it and add new functionalities. \n* Physical button.\n* They are transparent on the issues they have faced in the past, you can see them here: [https:\/\/trezor.io\/security\/](https:\/\/trezor.io\/security\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ColdCard (Bitcoin Only)\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* No confirmed hacks!\n* They've had an issue regarding a flaw that could trick users into sending Bitcoin on the mainnet when they meant to use its testnet. You can read about it here: [https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/tech\/2020\/11\/25\/bypass-attack-in-coldcard-bitcoin-wallet-could-trick-users-into-sending-incorrect-funds\/](https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/tech\/2020\/11\/25\/bypass-attack-in-coldcard-bitcoin-wallet-could-trick-users-into-sending-incorrect-funds\/)\n\n***How secure are they?***\n\n* Offline storage. \n* They are sent to you in a temper evident bag. \n* PIN code as main defence (has a seed phrase too) - without PIN, there are no backdoors, hints or alternative ways to get into cold card.\n* Passphrase security - this is a password added to your 24 word security phrase. This pass phrase protects your assets if your 24-word recover phrase is compromised, so this means that the attacker will need your seed phrase as well as your secret passphrase. \n* Bank-grade SE with partially\/fully closed source firmware - idea is that the attacker cannot exploit system if they have no knowledge of it.\n* Incremental time delays between attempts on PIN&gt;\n* Even after brute force against pin, the SHA-256 along with TRNG offers further protection, the search space is now 2\\^256. \n* Air-gapped. \n* Physical button.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# KeepKey\n\n***Have they been hacked in the past?***\n\n* No confirmed hackings.\n* Hacker claimed they hacked marketing and website servers but never confirmed.\n* Kraken said they could crack their device (same method as for Tezor) but KeepKey has denied this. \n\n***How secure are they?***\n\n* Offline storage.\n* Pin protection against unauthorised use.\n* Passphrase security - this is a password added to your 24 word security phrase. This pass phrase protects your assets if your 24-word recover phrase is compromised, so this means that the attacker will need your seed phrase as well as your secret passphrase. \n* Number randomisation - the KeepKey wallet randomly shuffles your PIN number from time-to-time to prevent malware from copying your code and using it and gaining access to your digital assets.\n* Physical Button.\n* Seed Phrse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    What does ALL this mean for the CHADS and the BRADS?\n\nAs I stated from the start, I have a bias but not choosing sides. But the battle can end here, most popular methods are safe from hacks and malicious actors, your funds regardless are safe but do have some disadvantages and advantages.\n\n# A message to the exchange CHADS\n\nOn face value, it seems that the exchanges win and are safer! This is not exactly true, I analysed popular exchanges but the list not exhaustive, exchange hacks are far more often than you think, there have been 52 known hacking events. You can see the timeline here: [https:\/\/cryptosec.info\/exchange-hacks\/](https:\/\/cryptosec.info\/exchange-hacks\/)\n\nBut you guys are not far from the BRADS as you might thing. Even these popular exchanges, even though they may say outright, probably secure your funds on cold storage and it's safe to assume that they like use services\/devices of the popular hardware wallet providers. For example, Crypto.com states that they are partnered with Ledger. \n\nYou also have to admit that there is still the issue of a central service controlling your funds and more importantly, your withdrawals. When shit hits the fan, some may stop you. Read some articles from the recent dip in May where users from different exchange\/liquidity pools experienced website crashes and removal of withdrawals. \n\n# \n\n# A message to the hardware wallet BRADS\n\nHardware wallets are pretty secure, actually damn secure, but not fool proof. Also, having funds on an exchange doesn't mean you are screwed. Typing in \"not your keys, not your coins\" won't automatically win you an argument - I know some of the OGs who witnesses Mt Gox may say otherwise, but the research shows that many of the biggest exchanges do care about the funds and some even are insured. \n\nI'm on your team, but we have to be practical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Reconciling the CHADS and the BRADS\n\nSo BRADS, CHADS, here we are. It seems that both of your methods are actually quite secure but of course black swan events are always possible (never forget Murphy's Law!)\n\nBut I found a huge issue and a HUGE liability in both exchanges and hardware wallets. It's.............................................................**YOU.** Yes! You! You are the biggest risk to your cryptocurrency loss, all these different security checks and functions won't safe your funds from you. So I offer you from advice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Advice for the exchange CHADS\n\n* Enable 2FA on your account - ideally you want to use 2FA application such as Google authenticator rather than your phone number; this avoids the risk of a SIM swap. \n* Enable whitelisting for addresses.\n* Check for malware on your computer.\n* Never respond to phishing emails - exchanges will never ask you for your password. \n* Check if your email has been compromised, if it has, don't use it - [https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/](https:\/\/haveibeenpwned.com\/)\n* On the email itself, you should have a recovery email and a 2FA for extra security. \n* Do not reuse password - don't use the password for your Miniclip and Runescape account for your exchange account. (Side note: I am currently trimming rune armour at the Grand Exchange for free if anyone is keen). \n* Don't use dodge exchanges to avoid fees or for better returns - if an exchange promises 90% APY on your elonrocketcoin then it's probably not legit. \n* Ideally, have a computer that doesn't run on windows just for your crypto - THIS IS FOR GIGA CHADS ONLY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Advice for hardware wallet BRADS\n\n* Don't give your hardware wallet to anyone (even without PIN, Seed Phrase or Passphrase).\n* When buying a hardware wallet, make sure the anti-tampering seals on the device are there and if possible, buy directly from the official website rather than a third party. Saving $30 from a third party, may not be the best if you end up losing all your funds.\n* Do not hold your seed phrase or PIN or pass phrase digitally or on perishable material such as paper, stamp or engrave it onto metal or use another metal device.\n* !!WARNING: SELF PROMOTION AHEAD!! I have a business that sells 204 grade durable stainless steel plates. They come in a variety of colours and pre-orders are available in October 2021. Check us out at [www.testudo.co.nz](https:\/\/www.testudo.co.nz) or search up TESTUDO crypto on google and it should be the first result. \n* Here is a list of metal back ups and their strength: [https:\/\/jlopp.github.io\/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews\/](https:\/\/jlopp.github.io\/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews\/)\n* Do not put your seed phrase next to your hardware wallet device. This is stupid. \n* When sending or receiving crypto, make sure that you check the first 5 letters\/numbers of the address and the last 5 letters\/numbers of the address to ensure that they match with whoever you are receiving from\/sending to. If you see that it's different or changing, you may have clipboard malware. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Mini note: For CHADS that want to be BRADS\n\nMany of you that hold your crypto on exchanges want to transfer it to a hardware wallet but too scared to do so. That's fine but understand that it's a very simple process. Do a little bit of crypto so you can get some mental confirmation that it does work! I know that gas fees are a huge on some cryptos, so grab a small amount of a crypto with small transaction fees (NANO or XML for example) and practice with that!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Do be a CHAD or a BRAD?\n\nIt's personal choice! You decide what you like to do based on the information provided. I think that if you are just a HODLer, become a hardware wallet BRAD, you can control your funds and keep them secure, but if you are someone who trades, participates in liquidity pools, and move funds a lot then it's probably a better idea to be a CHAD because you can avoid significant transaction fees from moving your funds from a hardware wallet to an exchange and vice versa. \n\nBut if I told you, you could be both? OMG!!! You can hold some of your crypto in the exchange (the ones you want to move around and trade etc) and have your HODL bag in a hardware wallet! \n\nBut in the end, it's up to you and what you prefer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\/TLDR\n\nCHADS and BRADS neither of you are correct nor incorrect. The main issue comes to individuals not practicing basic security in regard to their crypto holding medium. Crypto is still a financial wild wild west - you asked for decentralisaition, you got it. Now it is up to you to secure your bag. Remember, insurance on an exchange doesn't mean that you will be safe from everything - they won't cover a single SAT caused by your ignorance. Keep your funds safe guys. Cheers.\n\nAnd of course:\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/rnr70zpptml71.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#","27":"Each time a Binance discussion starts its fk them, their shitty customer service, they are scammers, they list whatever shitcoin, etc etc...

I used their launchpool and launchpads and this alone already gave me back like 1\/3 of my initial investment back. They started the ETH 2.0 staking program very fast in December 2020 and i also got in -Then i regret not waiting and get into BETH directly when it was 0.89- but still was really nice getting into it early since rewards have been good. They release good staking oportunities like BTC locked for 3 months at 7% apy...\n\nI never had a problem with their site, i move funds in and out from BSC to farm over there when oportunities are great. I understand that sometimes they have issues going down when usage goes into max capacity as other exchanges suffer the same, i dont trade so i really dont care much about this but i understand that for a trader they must find the best platform to avoid this.

I figured I would help share what I have learned from being in the scene since early 2013.\n\n**1. Don\u2019t ever trust unsolicited messages about crypto.** If you get DMed on Reddit, Discord, Twitter, email, or whatever else from a stranger, it\u2019s a scam. Don\u2019t click their links, don\u2019t recover their seed phrase, don\u2019t install their software, don\u2019t take their advice.\n\n**2. Do Your Own Research.** Never make an investment based on one source of information. Not Reddit, not your friend, not a social media influencer, not from a website. You can utilize all of these as part of your research, but always research from multiple sources and seek out opinions for and against your investments for the best assessment. Often times a single source will be biased or under-informed.**\n\n**3. Have a plan.**\nKnow what your goals are and stick to them. If you think BTC will go to $100,000 and if you sell yours then you can pay off your student loans, then set a sell order now for it and let it happen. Don\u2019t watch it go to $115,000 thinking it will go to $200,000 now only to panic sell for $35,000 at the bottom of the next bear market. Remove your emotions and stick to your plan.\n\n**4. Invest for the long-term. Do not play \/ try to time the market.** If you want to gamble with $50 for fun, sure. If you want to make meaningful money and get that financial independence, lambo, whatever, then find something you think will only be better in 5 years and hold it until you reach your goals. If try to buy low and sell high you will statistically do worse.\n\n**5. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) works.** Investing a set amount each paycheck helps to stick to your plan, remove emotion, avoid FOMO, and help you to secure a good price.\n\n**6. A hardware wallet is good for reasons you may not think.**\nYes, you can be your own bank. In the age of rug pulls, hack scandals, and more that IS valuable. What you might not consider is that it also creates an additional barrier to prevent panic selling. Several times I have been tempted to sell but the extra effort of needing to get into my hardware wallet and transfer it to an exchange to sell was enough to get me to keep holding.\n\n**7. Price does not matter. Market cap does.** If a coin is only $0.01 that does not make it cheap, if there are 10000000000000000000000 coins in existence. If it went to $1 it would be more money than exists in the world. Measure a coin instead by market cap. (Price * total coins in circulation) if that meme coin got to a $1 it would be worth more than BTC and I wouldn\u2019t count on that happening.\n\n**8. If you are stressed out all the time unable to stop looking at charts, you are over invested.** Your mental health shouldn\u2019t be neglected and the stress won\u2019t help you make money anyway. Only invest what you can afford to lose, or at the very least can hold for years.\n\n**9. Don\u2019t be afraid to take profits.** You don\u2019t have to sell everything, but if you 10x don\u2019t be afraid to get out your initial investment and enjoy a guaranteed win. Bull markets come and go, small wins make holding long term that much easier.","34":"To short Bitcoin or Ethereum, you need to be an extremely experienced trader.\n\nFor the past 10 days, over 60.000 traders have lost about over $200M each day, sometimes even close to a billion.\n\nSome who have traded on extreme leverage (x125) have lost over $6000000 on a single trade shorting Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\nDo not short assests which hit all time high after all time high.

We are here for the long gains, but we keep checking charts, news and our favorite coins every hour or minute. **Try to lock a time of the day you will be reading crypto news, engaging with the community, checking charts**. Try to adapt to that and make it a habit, this way it becomes a natural part of your life and a fulfilling hobby. For example, I'm on a break from work, so I have more time at my disposal. So I've separated some time to be updating more on the crypto world and engage with the community, but I still have time to do errands, study, watch movies and have meaningful relationships, and crypto or any other thing doesn't come in the way.\n2. **Exercise and eat well**: a healthy body is key to a heathy mind. In the beginning, it's not easy for a sedentary to become an active person. Do it slowly. It took years for you to be on your actual state, so have in mind that will take some time to adapt to a new routine.\n3. **Don't leave your job or disengage from it**: keep your job and keep engaged to it. Being a work slave is exhausting and we all (most of us) want to retire early and actually enjoy life. But we can find ways to better our lives even within our current reality. It's a good feeling to find someone who is good at their job and they can help you, right? So try to be this person that restores faith in people to others and earn some dirty fiat along the way to fomo in SOL or LUNA. \n4. **Have a strategy**: define what you want from crypto, huge long gains (HODL), short term gains or a mix of both. If you need to constantly check on a coin, make sure you have a reason for it. If you invested on a coin  to forget about it and become rich in 10 years, it makes no sense to obsess about its chart everyday.\n5. **Try to find other ways to spend your time and things to look for**: if you disengage from crypto completely, even for one week, you will feel naturally more detached from it and open to new interests. Try and find one that can be mentally challenging and improve your life and mood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of us are privileged, specially in perspective to extremely poor people around the world, now and in the past. To be born at this time in history is a privilege on itself, as being testimony to the rise of the Internet and Crypto is something of its own. Don't let this privilege turn into something negative and let crypto be a fulfilling hobby for you, not an obsession.","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"So I'm relatively new compared to a lot of people on this sub, I first put money into crypto in May. Wonderful timing, I know. I had a long summer watching the charts turn red.\n\nI was procrastinating at my desk and wondering how crypto has changed your life? For better, or worse? Did you have a goal for a return on your initial investment that you've been able to meet? Did you go on a wild shopping spree with your earnings, or reinvest?

Institutions who are holding large bags (at a profit) can dump it in the market, instantly lowering the price. To make it more convincing, institutions often also control the media, and can release some fake FUD.\n\nThis is also called \"shaking out the weak hands\". It's present in stock market as well (see this article by the legendary Wyckoff: [https:\/\/financialpost.com\/investing\/the-secret-trading-strategy-from-the-1930s-that-hedge-funders-dont-want-you-to-know-about](https:\/\/financialpost.com\/investing\/the-secret-trading-strategy-from-the-1930s-that-hedge-funders-dont-want-you-to-know-about))\n\n**When:** This can happen any time, but a popular time for institutional shakeout is close to the last Friday of the month where options expire. This has the additional benefit that the institutional option-sellers can collect the maximum premium (where retail call options expire worthless).\n\nInstitutions also don't want to sell at a loss, so shakeout usually happens when most addresses holdings are in profits. \n\n**Why:** Institutions want to take profits, and at the same time send the price lower so that they can buy in lower. Rinse and repeat, it's easy money for the institutions.\n\n# What to do for newcomers:\n\n1) Avoid selling at a loss, if you believe in crypto. Crypto has such promising upwards potential, it is very likely a great mistake to sell at a loss.\n\n2) Hodl tight. Be careful of \"stop losses\" at round numbers, institutions can use it to shake weak hands effectively.\n\n3) DCA, buy the dip to lower your price average. The lower your price average, the safer you are from such shakeouts in the future.","57":"Corona was\/is a dark time for us and alot of us lost people we cared about.

It turns out that 207 users have participated in all 16 rounds!  There are another 13 people who received karma on the sub for all 16 rounds *but never opened their vault*!

And in fact, according to [testnet.redditspace.com\/tokens](https:\/\/testnet.redditspace.com\/tokens) there are in over 100K MOON token holders.  This was a real mystery to me and caused me to re-do my entire analysis thinking I'd missed something, until I realized those extra \\~30K addresses most likely \"belong\" to people with no open vaults.  if they ever do open them (prior to the 6 month time limit at which point they disappear) then they would get one of those.  But the fact is, there are only 77,583 unique users (commoners, not counting admins or whoever doesn't appear in the distribution lists) who have received any Moons in a vault.  There are almost 200K separate users identified in total in all the finalized Moon snapshots (199,371 to be precise), so that means less than half of the users who ever were offered Moons took them.","59":"I want show the owner of my favorite caf\u00e9 the benefits of accepting crypto.

The token includes a key deflationary mechanism to control the rate at which new ETH is issued. The rate of issuance is currently capped at a 16million per year, however, over time this will continue to become smaller as the difficulty and computing power required to mine will increase.\n\nThe block reward for miners who successfully confirms a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain started at 5ETH back in 2015. After several hard-forks increasing the difficulty of mining the block reward now sits at 2ETH.\n\n**Deflationary Mechanism of Ethereum**\n\nOn August 5th 2021 EIP-1559 (London Hard Fork) was released the update will introduce a minimum payment \u2013 the base gas fee- for Ethereum transactions, aiming to stabilise transaction fees. Depending on the network congestion, the base fee may adjust by up to 12.5%.\n\nAfter EIP-1559, every Ethereum block burns part of the transaction fees.\n\n**Ethereum Classic Vs Ethereum Vs Ethereum 2.0**\n\n**What is Ethereum Classic?** Ethereum Classic was the original token created back in 2015, however, after a vulnerability that was discovered in 2016 and $60million of ETH was stolen the community produced a hard fork to remove the vulnerability from the code base and essentially created an ETC and ETH fork. Both of which still co-exist today.\n\n**What is Ethereum 2.0?** Ethereum 2.0 is the name given for a series of major updates to the code base which will be implemented in several phases to transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) system (similar to how bitcoin works) to a proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. Currently, ETH 2.0 is expected to start rolling out sometime in 2022.\n\n**What is the Difference Between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake?** Both systems are consensus mechanisms used to confirm transactions on the blockchain.\n\nProof of work requires significant amounts of energy due to the exponentially increasing computing power required to solve the cryptographic proof to confirm a transaction on the blockchain (**Mining**). Proof of stake requires miners to hold a stake of ETH on the blockchain and use this \u2018guarantee\u2019 to secure the network of transactions (**Staking**).\n\nThe difference is that Proof of Stake should over time become a more economical and faster model for confirming transactions on the blockchain.\n\n**Should I Buy Ethereum NFTs**\n\nEthereum NFT\u2019s seem to be the buzzword of the crypto space in 2021, mainly due to the success of a number of NFT projects such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club and others such as Crypto-Kitties.\n\nIn August of 2021, one of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT tokens sold for over $12million at an auction at Sotheby\u2019s which seems to validate the demand for Ethereum based products.\n\nEthereum NFTs projects can be purchased using a leading exchange such as [OpenSea.IO](https:\/\/opensea.io\/) and linking your ETH based wallet such as Coinbase Wallet, or MetaMask. However, be aware that there are **Fake NFT\u2019s out there** so be sure you know what you are buying!\n\n**Summary and Closing Statement**\n\nThe crypto space at the moment is highly speculative and people buying should ensure they are investing in projects which are inside their circle of competence to make a judgment on if they are good or poor investments.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my Ethereum Report for beginners, if you're interested in reading the full guide here's the resource: [Should I Buy Ethereum 2021?](https:\/\/prophet-invest.com\/should-i-buy-ethereum) :)","62":"I don't know for you guys but Link has been pretty quiet these past months. It's doing it's thing slowly but surely and I believe there's more under it's belt. Maybe not now; in the future but LINK in my opinion is going to stay and play among the big ones.  The Chainlink 2.0 whitepaper was written by a team of world-class academic researchers specializing in fields like security, cryptography, distributed systems, game theory, mathematics, and various other computer science related disciplines. The team itself is solid and there is little projects that goes on without adopting imo the **\" The King of Decentralized Oracle Networks \"** (Some of their clients are Celsius, AAVE, Google Cloud; just to name a few).\n\nAs for the price: if you zoom out for the past 6 months, we noticed we've been trading sideways with a higher high topping around the $52 cap. After the crash we recover from a low of $13 to recent trading price of $30 ( a 2x for anyone who bought at the bottom). I believe LINK is to stay and there much coming especially if BTC is on bullish mode which will result in good traction for generally all the ALTs but a booster for solid projects such as LINK. When crypto is booming, new startup and projects will flower and when they do, they imo will adopt the best leaders in their field. LINK being great by providing off-chain data and services  will surely be adopted and benefits from it.","63":"","64":"","65":"I get that we all want crypto to be big.

It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, motivated by a potentially higher scalability over blockchain based distributed ledgers.\n\n#**Why is IOTA rising so rapidly?**\n\nIn the last months IOTA upgraded their mainnet which required everyone to migrate their tokens, including exchanges. Binance and other exchanges disabled deposits and withdrawals during that time.\n\nBinance uses custom Ledger hardware devices and software on their backend. So they had to wait on Ledger to update their software integration. Just recently they were able to resume withdrawals.\n\nSince Binance is roughly ~80% of IOTAs trading volume, coin supply on exchanges went up since nobody was able to withdraw. Simultaneously big short positions built up as well.\n\n#**The Breakout**\n\nThe short squeeze began, millions in short positions rekt as Binance resumes withdrawals after months. People were desperately waiting to withdraw all their IOTAs since they were so fed up with exchanges gatekeeping their coins.\n\nLiquid supply became illiquid really rapidly. Less exchange supply means higher prices.\n\n#**The Technology**\n\nIOTA recently announced, running smart contracts on the current decentralized devnet. This is quite an advancement, but certainly not really the reason for the current outbreak.\n\nI can recommend everyone to check out IOTAs roadmap and goals towards crypto innovation. They are by far the ones that are advancing the most towards solving the limitations of the blockchain and the trilemma between security, scalability and decentralization. Feeless transactions are unarguably the future of DeFi crypto.\n\nIOTA received a lot of hate from the community since they were often too optimistic with ETAs and deadlines in the past. Nonetheless they are advancing with a completely new approach on crypto, with not really many projects to compare to. \u2014 I\u2019d say IOTA just reached their normal coin value again, since they had a similar valuation before the -50% market crash caused by Tesla, China bans, Leverage capitulation etc.","80":"Like really I can\u2019t stress this enough\u2026 You get insecure that since it\u2019s a bull run you might see red and your losses might be big?

An ERC-20 contract is very simple, and more or less only contains the following functionality:\n\n* Creates a supply of a token as an integer value when the contract is created and assigns it all to one address to start\n* Keeps track of a mapping of addresses-&gt;balances\n* Allows an address with a positive balance to transfer part of their balance to another address\n* Allows an address to authorize other addresses (or smart contracts) to transfer tokens on their behalf\n\nThere's slightly more to it than that, but honestly not that much.\n\nWhy do you need to know this?  Because you should never assume that your tokens are \"safe\" because they are in your wallet.  You do not actually ever have direct control over your tokens.  If the contract for the ERC-20 token you are using was not implemented according to the standard, it's very easy for things to go wrong.\n\nAlso, if you are using DeFi platforms and exchanges, you more than likely have had to submit transactions to authorize a spend limit on every token you traded.  Sometimes the exchange defaults to an infinite spend limit so you don't have to do it every time you transact.  What you may not realize is that the spend limit gives another address control over your balance of ERC-20 tokens, FOREVER, until it exceeds the spend limit (which won't happen if it's infinite), or you submit another transaction to reduce the spend limit.  If there is ever some kind of vulnerability in the platform you are using, or it was written with some kind of backdoor, someone can go through the smart contract to yoink all of the coins that it has an approved spend limit for, even if they are sitting \"safely\" in your wallet.\n\nThe above is also true when you deposit your tokens into liquidity pools or stake them.  Usually you will get back some kind of pool token in return, which is just another ERC-20 token.  There's a very good chance the smart contract has the ability to pull those tokens away from your address (and is in fact designed to do so).  Be aware that a malicious actor might find a way to exploit the code to pull these pool tokens to their benefit.\n\nIt's also possible for subtle modifications to the ERC-20 contract standard to lead to hidden back doors that might allow for the creator of a token to transfer other peoples' tokens at any point in time.  Do not assume that all ERC-20 tokens are created equal.  The accepted implementations of the standard itself have also changed over time.  To see what the current template looks like, you can at openzeppelin's implementation here:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/OpenZeppelin\/openzeppelin-contracts\/blob\/9b3710465583284b8c4c5d2245749246bb2e0094\/contracts\/token\/ERC20\/ERC20.sol","82":"We know Bitcoin is mined through a proof-of-work consensus mechanisms and mines get issued new coins and there\u2019s a schedule for how many coins they get.

When you go to the bank and ask for a million dollar loan, the bank isn\u2019t taking that million from someone else who deposited money in the bank, the bank is making, or essentially mining new money.

By not staking your coins in these protocols, you're essentially losing money to inflation.

Yes! Are there great ideas and innovative thought? Yes! Am I surprised to hear that the testnet is failing? Not at all. Would a major flaw kill Cardano? Maybe, and it might take another 4 years to make a second cut.\n\nReading through the Plutus Pioneer material and messages, there is an overwhelming attitude that if you don\u2019t understand UTXO and Haskell, it\u2019s your own fault, and you should take a few years to study before you continue. \u201cPlutus is a mathematician programmer\u2019s program for mathematics programmers programming mathematics. If you don\u2019t spend as long studying, as we took to build it, fuck you\u201d, is what the opening slide for the Plutus Pioneers program said (I think. It went by kind of fast so I may be paraphrasing. That\u2019s what it felt like it said). The second slide was for a lab where we are supposed to spend 4 years white boarding a Hello World smart contract. They want to make it clear that if they give us a nice shiny new platform, and we write garbage, we should self immolate. It\u2019s like Charles was still trying to incorporate proof-of-work, and decided that developers needed to solve an increasingly more complicated development environment if they wanted to produce a contract on the chain. \n\nPlutus and Cardano, with its weird 1980s views on SDLC and waterfall methodology, may eventually produce some great stuff, but it\u2019s going to take years for some projects to ramp up and release. Meanwhile, start ups will come along and try to go to market quickly, without the proper skills, and there will be a flood of slow and sloppy code, all blamed on Cardano.\nIt\u2019s going to be like back in the 90s when every high school kid was writing Java applets for web sites. They were terribly written, slow, and hated by users, to the point that you never see Java applets on websites anymore.\nMaybe I\u2019m not smart. I\u2019ll totally buy that.

This makes ETH the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nEthereum unlike Bitcoin does not have a fixed amount of coins (coin-cap) however has other deflationary measures in place to control circulating supply.\n\n**Summary Statistics**\n\n* **Asset:** Ether (ETH)\n* **Inception of Network:** 30th July 2015\n* **Current Price (USD):** $3,865\n* **Coin Market Cap (USD):** $453billion\n* **Circulating Supply (As of Writing):** 117,394,131 ETH\n* **Current Mining Block Reward:** 2 ETH\n* **Is Fixed Supply (Coin-Cap):** No\n* **Level of Decentralization:** Top 2 hold &gt; 50% hash rate\n\n**About The Project**\n\nEthereum is a blockchain product that can essentially be described as an operating system for the blockchain. Ethereum is primarily used to build decentralised applications (Dapps) the project achieves this by combining the blockchain with a complete Turing programming language.\n\nEthereum is based on the concept of \u201cSmart Contracts\u201d, which essentially means that if certain conditions are met then a certain code can be run on the platform. This differs from its competitor bitcoin where a coin can typically only be \u2018spent or unspent\u2019 with only basic \u2018smart contract\u2019 functionality.\n\n**ETH Uses**\n\n* Token Systems (Such as NFT\u2019s)\n* Financial Derivitives and Stable-Value Currencies\n* Identity and Reputation Systems\n* Decentralised File Storage (DropBox but cheaper and decentralised)\n* Decentralised Anonymous Organisations\n* Insurance based contracts systems\n* Peer-to-peer gambling protocols\n\n**ICO- Initial Coin offering**\n\nUpon network creation, 72million ETH was created and allocated based on approximately $18million USD that was raised in their ICO sale. Around 83% of ETH were sold to the public at this point in time, with developers (85 individuals) and the Ethereum Foundation maintaining the 17%.\n\n**Ethereum Mining Reward History**\n\nAt creation 72million Ethereum tokens were created. The token includes a key deflationary mechanism to control the rate at which new ETH is issued. The rate of issuance is currently capped at a 16million per year, however, over time this will continue to become smaller as the difficulty and computing power required to mine will increase.\n\nThe block reward for miners who successfully confirms a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain started at 5ETH back in 2015. After several hard-forks increasing the difficulty of mining the block reward now sits at 2ETH.\n\n**Deflationary Mechanism of Ethereum**\n\nOn August 5th 2021 EIP-1559 (London Hard Fork) was released the update will introduce a minimum payment \u2013 the base gas fee- for Ethereum transactions, aiming to stabilise transaction fees. Depending on the network congestion, the base fee may adjust by up to 12.5%.\n\nAfter EIP-1559, every Ethereum block burns part of the transaction fees.\n\n**Ethereum Classic Vs Ethereum Vs Ethereum 2.0**\n\n**What is Ethereum Classic?** Ethereum Classic was the original token created back in 2015, however, after a vulnerability that was discovered in 2016 and $60million of ETH was stolen the community produced a hard fork to remove the vulnerability from the code base and essentially created an ETC and ETH fork. Both of which still co-exist today.\n\n**What is Ethereum 2.0?** Ethereum 2.0 is the name given for a series of major updates to the code base which will be implemented in several phases to transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) system (similar to how bitcoin works) to a proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. Currently, ETH 2.0 is expected to start rolling out sometime in 2022.\n\n**What is the Difference Between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake?** Both systems are consensus mechanisms used to confirm transactions on the blockchain.\n\nProof of work requires significant amounts of energy due to the exponentially increasing computing power required to solve the cryptographic proof to confirm a transaction on the blockchain (**Mining**). Proof of stake requires miners to hold a stake of ETH on the blockchain and use this \u2018guarantee\u2019 to secure the network of transactions (**Staking**).\n\nThe difference is that Proof of Stake should over time become a more economical and faster model for confirming transactions on the blockchain.\n\n**Should I Buy Ethereum NFTs**\n\nEthereum NFT\u2019s seem to be the buzzword of the crypto space in 2021, mainly due to the success of a number of NFT projects such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club and others such as Crypto-Kitties.\n\nIn August of 2021, one of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT tokens sold for over $12million at an auction at Sotheby\u2019s which seems to validate the demand for Ethereum based products.\n\nEthereum NFTs projects can be purchased using a leading exchange such as [OpenSea.IO](https:\/\/opensea.io\/) and linking your ETH based wallet such as Coinbase Wallet, or MetaMask. However, be aware that there are **Fake NFT\u2019s out there** so be sure you know what you are buying!\n\n**Summary and Closing Statement**\n\nThe crypto space at the moment is highly speculative and people buying should ensure they are investing in projects which are inside their circle of competence to make a judgment on if they are good or poor investments.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my Ethereum Report for beginners, if you're interested in reading the full guide here's the resource: [Should I Buy Ethereum 2021?](https:\/\/prophet-invest.com\/should-i-buy-ethereum) :)","127":" Welcome to the \/r\/CryptoMarkets Weekly Discussion thread.

It eliminates order books and is an interesting feature compared to centralised exchanges (CEXs).\n\nThe main innovations from the Uniswap protocol are the development of a user-friendly platform on which traders can easily swap tokens, while at the same time enabling anyone to be a provider of liquidity and earn passive income through transaction fees.\n\n# How does Uniswap Work?\n\nThe Uniswap protocol does things differently to CEX. It allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens without the need for a middleman. As well as helping to reduce fees, this can iron out some thorny issues concerning censorship.\n\n \n\nUniswap is a 100% decentralised and permissionless protocol, operating on the following formula: xy=k (called \u201cconstant product\u201d)\n\nIn which:\n\n* x is amount token X;\n* y is amount token Y;\n* k is a constant\n\nUniswap provides an environment for the parties (Liquidity provider, trader, arbitrageurs and developer) to trade and develop.\n\nLiquidity Providers (LPs)\u00a0 provide liquidity by depositing Erc-20 tokens into the pool and they receive LP token back as a certificate of ownership of a portion of this pool. After a while, they will be paid with the pool's transaction fees.\n\nTraders participating in trading must pay a fee for each transaction. This fee is stored in the pool and paid to the LP.\n\nArbitrageurs align the price difference between the internal market and external markets.\n\n## For example\n\nThe pool created is ETH\/DAI with 10 $ETH and 1000 $DAI. We have:\n\n&gt;x \\* y = k \u21d4 10 \\* 1000 = 10,000. And 1 $ETH = 100 $DAI and 1 $DAI = 0.01 $ETH.\n\n### Case 1: Swap DAI for ETH.\n\nTrader A enters this pool and swaps 500 $DAI + 0.3% fee to exchange it for $ETH.\n\n\u21d2 y1 = 500 + 1000 = 1500 $DAI.\n\nk is const \u21d2 x1 = k \/ y1 = 6.66 $ETH.\n\nThe trader receives x - x1 = 10 - 6.66 = 3.33 $ETH, which is worth 500 $DAI.\n\n\u21d2 1 $ETH = 150.15 $DAI, increase 50.15% from the initial price.\n\n**Note**: 0.3% fee will be added back to the pool after swapping and changes the value of k.\n\n### Case 2: Swap ETH for DAI.\n\nTrader B sells 6 $ETH in exchange for $DAI.\n\n\u21d2 x1 = 10 + 6 = 16.\n\n\u21d2 y1 = 10,000 \/ 16 = 625.\n\nIt follows that the trader gets y - y1 = 1000 - 625 = 375 $DAI, which is worth 6 $ETH.\n\n\u21d2 1 $ETH = 62.5 $DAI, 37.5% decrease from the initial price.\n\n**Note**: If the slippage is too large, Uniswap will issue a warning before you swap to display a notification.\n\n## New Price Each Token\n\nThe price of the token is determined after a change in reserves. This means the current transaction price is the price of the token which is redetermined at the previous transaction.\n\nThe token price in re-calculated. Hence,\n\n&gt;New Price of $X Token = \u2206y\/\u2206x.\n\nIn Case 1: New 1 $ETH = |y1-y| \/ |x1-x| = 500\/3.33 = 150.15 $DAI.\n\n \n\n**TLDR:**\n\nUniswap V3 combines the benefits of a standard AMM with those of an asset-stable AMM, plus other functions that make using capital more efficient. This makes V3 a super flexible protocol that can accommodate a wide variety of assets.\n\nUniswap V3 can change the game on AMM. It also poses many problems for related projects. Of course when the problem is solved, it is the opportunity!","142":" IX Swap is the first ever platform to provide liquidity pools and automated market making functions for the security token (STO) &amp; tokenized stock industry (TSO).\u00a0 \n\nCheck more details about IXS token sale [here](https:\/\/read.cash\/@Damian.Adams\/ix-swap-is-ready-for-a-full-blown-takeoff-3667f4b3).\n\n[Source: https:\\\/\\\/www.kucoin.com\\\/blog\\\/en\\_US\\\/join-ixs-token-sale-on-kucoin-spotlight](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zp1yb75blnl71.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f42f6eb84073c90d8494a8c49e5e4fc2f4fcc534)","143":"","144":"Assuming Kraken accept transferring that much in fiat currency.\n\nmost banks in my country (France) are reluctant to deal with founds originating from crypto.","145":"Hello all,\n\nI am unsure whether or not this has its place here, but if I dont try I will never know.\n\nAs we all know, crypto has known quite the popularity these past months.

This makes ETH the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nEthereum unlike Bitcoin does not have a fixed amount of coins (coin-cap) however has other deflationary measures in place to control circulating supply.\n\n**Summary Statistics**\n\n* **Asset:** Ether (ETH)\n* **Inception of Network:** 30th July 2015\n* **Current Price (USD):** $3,865\n* **Coin Market Cap (USD):** $453billion\n* **Circulating Supply (As of Writing):** 117,394,131 ETH\n* **Current Mining Block Reward:** 2 ETH\n* **Is Fixed Supply (Coin-Cap):** No\n* **Level of Decentralization:** Top 2 hold &gt; 50% hash rate\n\n**About The Project**\n\nEthereum is a blockchain product that can essentially be described as an operating system for the blockchain. Ethereum is primarily used to build decentralised applications (Dapps) the project achieves this by combining the blockchain with a complete Turing programming language.\n\nEthereum is based on the concept of \u201cSmart Contracts\u201d, which essentially means that if certain conditions are met then a certain code can be run on the platform. This differs from its competitor bitcoin where a coin can typically only be \u2018spent or unspent\u2019 with only basic \u2018smart contract\u2019 functionality.\n\n**ETH Uses**\n\n* Token Systems (Such as NFT\u2019s)\n* Financial Derivitives and Stable-Value Currencies\n* Identity and Reputation Systems\n* Decentralised File Storage (DropBox but cheaper and decentralised)\n* Decentralised Anonymous Organisations\n* Insurance based contracts systems\n* Peer-to-peer gambling protocols\n\n**ICO- Initial Coin offering**\n\nUpon network creation, 72million ETH was created and allocated based on approximately $18million USD that was raised in their ICO sale. Around 83% of ETH were sold to the public at this point in time, with developers (85 individuals) and the Ethereum Foundation maintaining the 17%.\n\n**Ethereum Mining Reward History**\n\nAt creation 72million Ethereum tokens were created. The token includes a key deflationary mechanism to control the rate at which new ETH is issued. The rate of issuance is currently capped at a 16million per year, however, over time this will continue to become smaller as the difficulty and computing power required to mine will increase.\n\nThe block reward for miners who successfully confirms a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain started at 5ETH back in 2015. After several hard-forks increasing the difficulty of mining the block reward now sits at 2ETH.\n\n**Deflationary Mechanism of Ethereum**\n\nOn August 5th 2021 EIP-1559 (London Hard Fork) was released the update will introduce a minimum payment \u2013 the base gas fee- for Ethereum transactions, aiming to stabilise transaction fees. Depending on the network congestion, the base fee may adjust by up to 12.5%.\n\nAfter EIP-1559, every Ethereum block burns part of the transaction fees.\n\n**Ethereum Classic Vs Ethereum Vs Ethereum 2.0**\n\n**What is Ethereum Classic?** Ethereum Classic was the original token created back in 2015, however, after a vulnerability that was discovered in 2016 and $60million of ETH was stolen the community produced a hard fork to remove the vulnerability from the code base and essentially created an ETC and ETH fork. Both of which still co-exist today.\n\n**What is Ethereum 2.0?** Ethereum 2.0 is the name given for a series of major updates to the code base which will be implemented in several phases to transition Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) system (similar to how bitcoin works) to a proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol. Currently, ETH 2.0 is expected to start rolling out sometime in 2022.\n\n**What is the Difference Between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake?** Both systems are consensus mechanisms used to confirm transactions on the blockchain.\n\nProof of work requires significant amounts of energy due to the exponentially increasing computing power required to solve the cryptographic proof to confirm a transaction on the blockchain (**Mining**). Proof of stake requires miners to hold a stake of ETH on the blockchain and use this \u2018guarantee\u2019 to secure the network of transactions (**Staking**).\n\nThe difference is that Proof of Stake should over time become a more economical and faster model for confirming transactions on the blockchain.\n\n**Should I Buy Ethereum NFTs**\n\nEthereum NFT\u2019s seem to be the buzzword of the crypto space in 2021, mainly due to the success of a number of NFT projects such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club and others such as Crypto-Kitties.\n\nIn August of 2021, one of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT tokens sold for over $12million at an auction at Sotheby\u2019s which seems to validate the demand for Ethereum based products.\n\nEthereum NFTs projects can be purchased using a leading exchange such as [OpenSea.IO](https:\/\/opensea.io\/) and linking your ETH based wallet such as Coinbase Wallet, or MetaMask. However, be aware that there are **Fake NFT\u2019s out there** so be sure you know what you are buying!\n\n**Summary and Closing Statement**\n\nThe crypto space at the moment is highly speculative and people buying should ensure they are investing in projects which are inside their circle of competence to make a judgment on if they are good or poor investments.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my Ethereum Report for beginners, if you're interested in reading the full guide here's the resource: [Should I Buy Ethereum 2021?](https:\/\/prophet-invest.com\/should-i-buy-ethereum) :)","189":"","190":"","191":"**Who:** Institutions\/ Whales who have sufficient holdings to move the market price\n\n**What\/How:** It's the oldest trick in the book. Institutions who are holding large bags (at a profit) can dump it in the market, instantly lowering the price. To make it more convincing, institutions often also control the media, and can release some fake FUD.\n\nThis is also called \"shaking out the weak hands\". It's present in stock market as well (see this article by the legendary Wyckoff: [https:\/\/financialpost.com\/investing\/the-secret-trading-strategy-from-the-1930s-that-hedge-funders-dont-want-you-to-know-about](https:\/\/financialpost.com\/investing\/the-secret-trading-strategy-from-the-1930s-that-hedge-funders-dont-want-you-to-know-about))\n\n**When:** This can happen any time, but a popular time for institutional shakeout is close to the last Friday of the month where options expire. This has the additional benefit that the institutional option-sellers can collect the maximum premium (where retail call options expire worthless).\n\nInstitutions also don't want to sell at a loss, so shakeout usually happens when most addresses holdings are in profits.\n\n**Why:** Institutions want to take profits, and at the same time send the price lower so that they can buy in lower. Rinse and repeat, it's easy money for the institutions.\n\n# What to do for newcomers:\n\n1. Avoid selling at a loss, if you believe in ETH. ETH has such promising upwards potential, it is very likely a great mistake to sell at a loss.\n2. Hodl tight. Be careful of \"stop losses\" at round numbers, institutions can use it to shake weak hands effectively.\n3. DCA, buy the dip to lower your price average.

It eliminates order books and is an interesting feature compared to centralised exchanges (CEXs).\n\nThe main innovations from the Uniswap protocol are the development of a user-friendly platform on which traders can easily swap tokens, while at the same time enabling anyone to be a provider of liquidity and earn passive income through transaction fees.\n\n# How does Uniswap Work?\n\nThe Uniswap protocol does things differently to CEX. It allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens without the need for a middleman. As well as helping to reduce fees, this can iron out some thorny issues concerning censorship.\n\n \n\nUniswap is a 100% decentralised and permissionless protocol, operating on the following formula: xy=k (called \u201cconstant product\u201d)\n\nIn which:\n\n* x is amount token X;\n* y is amount token Y;\n* k is a constant\n\nUniswap provides an environment for the parties (Liquidity provider, trader, arbitrageurs and developer) to trade and develop.\n\nLiquidity Providers (LPs)\u00a0 provide liquidity by depositing Erc-20 tokens into the pool and they receive LP token back as a certificate of ownership of a portion of this pool. After a while, they will be paid with the pool's transaction fees.\n\nTraders participating in trading must pay a fee for each transaction. This fee is stored in the pool and paid to the LP.\n\nArbitrageurs align the price difference between the internal market and external markets.\n\n## For example\n\nThe pool created is ETH\/DAI with 10 $ETH and 1000 $DAI. We have:\n\n&gt;x \\* y = k \u21d4 10 \\* 1000 = 10,000. And 1 $ETH = 100 $DAI and 1 $DAI = 0.01 $ETH.\n\n### Case 1: Swap DAI for ETH.\n\nTrader A enters this pool and swaps 500 $DAI + 0.3% fee to exchange it for $ETH.\n\n\u21d2 y1 = 500 + 1000 = 1500 $DAI.\n\nk is const \u21d2 x1 = k \/ y1 = 6.66 $ETH.\n\nThe trader receives x - x1 = 10 - 6.66 = 3.33 $ETH, which is worth 500 $DAI.\n\n\u21d2 1 $ETH = 150.15 $DAI, increase 50.15% from the initial price.\n\n**Note**: 0.3% fee will be added back to the pool after swapping and changes the value of k.\n\n### Case 2: Swap ETH for DAI.\n\nTrader B sells 6 $ETH in exchange for $DAI.\n\n\u21d2 x1 = 10 + 6 = 16.\n\n\u21d2 y1 = 10,000 \/ 16 = 625.\n\nIt follows that the trader gets y - y1 = 1000 - 625 = 375 $DAI, which is worth 6 $ETH.\n\n\u21d2 1 $ETH = 62.5 $DAI, 37.5% decrease from the initial price.\n\n**Note**: If the slippage is too large, Uniswap will issue a warning before you swap to display a notification.\n\n## New Price Each Token\n\nThe price of the token is determined after a change in reserves. This means the current transaction price is the price of the token which is redetermined at the previous transaction.\n\nThe token price in re-calculated. Hence,\n\n&gt;New Price of $X Token = \u2206y\/\u2206x.\n\nIn Case 1: New 1 $ETH = |y1-y| \/ |x1-x| = 500\/3.33 = 150.15 $DAI.\n\n \n\n**TLDR:**\n\nUniswap V3 combines the benefits of a standard AMM with those of an asset-stable AMM, plus other functions that make using capital more efficient. This makes V3 a super flexible protocol that can accommodate a wide variety of assets.\n\nUniswap V3 can change the game on AMM. It also poses many problems for related projects.
